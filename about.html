        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is the country that I call home. To narrow it down, Vancouver is the city I call home. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia and have lived here all of my life. I've travelled within the Greater Vancouver
            Area, Vancouver Island, up to Whistler and far east of BC to the Okanagan Valley. 2016 was the first year that I've travelled to another province. The first city was Ottawa and then Montreal within the same trip. Soon after, I travelled back
            to Ottawa and Montreal. Just before the pandemic, there was plans to travel to more provinces.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pandemic, travel was limited since we were restricted to be within our own provinces boundaries. I started exploring the rest of British Columbia and travelled to new cities for the first time. There was a lot of scenery
            and then realized why British Columbia is one of the most beautiful places in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This site was build to showcase the beauty of all of Canada. When the pandemic starts to get better, I want to explore Canada first before the rest of the world so I can learn and teach the world about Canada. There is so much
            beauty in just British Columbia alone and it keeps growing everyday. Learning and being in other provinces and territories can help people recognize why Canada is the spot to visit.
